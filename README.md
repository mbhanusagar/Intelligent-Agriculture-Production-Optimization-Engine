"AgroOpti: Intelligent Agriculture Production Optimization Engine"

Abstract:

As an agricultural country, Indiaâ€™s economy is predominantly depended over production of yield from agriculture.
About half of the population of India depends on agriculture for its livelihood, but its contribution towards the GDP of India is
only 14 per cent. One possible reason for this is the lack of adequate crop planning by farmers. There is no system in place to
advice farmers what crops to grow. During the last decade the climate has become very uncertain. Due to this the farmers who
were planting traditional crops are now facing problems, the yield of their traditional crops is getting reduced, therefore the rate of
suicide done by farmers has increased specifically in India. In our study we found out that if farmers knew the yield of the crop
that they are planting beforehand, they would choose the crop that will produce better yield based on the climate of that region.
Knowing the crop yield before the harvest will also help farmers and policy makers to make important decisions. The application
that is developed in our research will help the user to predict the crop yield based on the climatic parameters, previous yield and
soil attributes. Using appropriate machine learning techniques, the model learns the correlation between the yield and features like
soil type, rainfall. The predictions can be useful for industries in the agricultural sector and farmers for proper choice of crops etc.
